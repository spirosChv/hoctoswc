# hoctoswc
Custom-based scripts to update an swc file from a hoc file. Specific usage for internal projects.

Code to use HOC morphology in order to modify an SWC file.
This code takes information from *.hoc, and the *.txt (user-defined), to modify an *.swc file.

opt.py: useful functions
run_code.py: execution script

For this example, cell.hoc, n123.CNG.swc, and description_compartments.txt are needed.
